# JKLMRuleSetManager

A user script for saving and applying sets of rules for PopSauce on [https://jklm.fun/](https://jklm.fun/). If you and your friends have found the perfect combination of tags and rules, this script allows you to save them and quickly reapply them when creating a new lobby.

## Requirements
This script requires a user script manager. I recommend [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

## Installation
