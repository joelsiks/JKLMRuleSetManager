# JKLMRuleSetManager

A script for saving/installing sets of rules for PopSauce on [https://jklm.fun/](https://jklm.fun/). If you and your friend have found the perfect set of tags to filter and scoring setup, you can save the currently selected rules and then easily install them whenever you create a new lobby.

This script requires a user script manager. I recommend [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

Click [HERE](JKLMRuleSetManager.user.js?raw=1) to be prompted to install the userscript in your script manager.
